**AI-Driven Product Recommendations for WooCommerce**
Unlock smarter WooCommerce product recommendations with AI. This feature allows admins to generate one-time WooCommerce recommended products effortlessly. Choose specific products, and personalize recommendations by adding product details like **Product Name** and **Product Description** to their WooCommerce product recommendation. Enhance AI product recommendations for WooCommerce by sharing store info in the ChatGPT prompt for more relevant WooCommerce product recommendations. Customize prompts using a **ready-made ChatGPT prompt**, simplifying the process for admins to generate intelligent WooCommerce product recommendations.

**Email Notifications for AI Product Recommendations**
Keep your customers engaged with timely WooCommerce recommended products. Admins can **seamlessly schedule email** to notify users about their recently viewed products for WooCommerce after a fixed period of 8 hours. The system intelligently retrieves the **top 5 priciest products viewed**, providing timely reminders without the risk of redundancy, as the same product won't be resent within 15 days. This keeps your WooCommerce product recommendations fresh and enticing.


This plugin comes with different types of widgets broadly classified into two categories aimed at boosting sales at every part of the customer journey.

**Pre-Purchase Recommendations Widgets:**

* <strong>Recently Viewed Products:</strong> This widget acts as a gentle reminder of the items that caught the customer's eye, encouraging them to take another look and perhaps make a purchase. The AJAX slider enhances user experience by loading products dynamically, keeping your site swift and responsive.

* <strong>Items Associated with Recently Viewed Products:</strong> It broadens the customer's product discovery by suggesting products associated with their recently viewed products. This not only increases the exposure of your inventory but also the chances of cross-selling.

* <strong>Recently Viewed Products Deals:</strong> This powerful feature targets the bargain hunters and deal seekers by showing them sale items associated with their recently viewed or purchased products. It's a strategic way to boost sales by tapping into the customer's desire for good deals on products they are already interested in.

**Post-Purchase Recommendation Widgets:**

* <strong>Reorder:</strong> The reorder feature simplifies the repurchase process for customers by adding a "Reorder" button directly within the WooCommerce "My Orders" page. This allows customers to quickly replicate a previous order, making it an invaluable tool for products that require regular replenishing.

With the [AI Product Recommendations Pro for WooCommerce](https://www.saffiretech.com/woocommerce-product-recommendations-pro/?utm_source=wp_plugin&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=free2pro&utm_id=c1&utm_term=upgrade_now&utm_content=prwfr), the PRO Version of the plugin, you get access to the following widgets and extra customization features:

* <strong>Buy-It-Again:</strong> Designed for convenience, this widget targets repeat purchases, displaying previously bought items that customers might need or want again. Its intuitive design, featuring checkboxes for easy selection and a bulk add-to-cart functionality, streamlines the repurchase process.

* <strong>Purchased Items Associated Products:</strong> This insightful widget gives product suggestions based on the products previously purchased by the customer. By analyzing past purchase behavior, it introduces customers to items that complement or enhance their prior purchases, driving both cross-sell and upsell opportunities.

**Product Discovery Widgets:**

* <strong>New Arrivals Widget:</strong> This widget dynamically showcases the most recently added products to your store, ensuring your customers are always aware of the latest offerings. Store owners have the flexibility to define what "new" means by setting a timeframe for recent additions, such as the last 15, 30, or 45 days. This feature keeps your store fresh and encourages repeat visits.

* <strong>Best Selling Products Widget:</strong> Leverage your store's sales data with this widget, which automatically highlights your best-selling products. By showcasing items that are already popular among your customers, this widget not only validates the product's appeal but also encourages others to explore and purchase these proven favorites.

* <strong>Featured Products Widget:</strong> Spotlight your premier products with ease. This widget displays items you've marked as "Featured" within the WooCommerce backend, allowing you to strategically promote specific products and guide customers towards your key offerings.

* <strong>Advanced Customization Options:</strong> Gain deeper control over the recommendations with options to exclude out-of-stock items, display product ratings, and tailor product suggestions based on categories and tags, offering a more refined shopping experience.

**Advanced AI Product Recommendations for WooCommerce**
Maximize the potential of AI product recommendations for WooCommerce with enhanced control and precision. Admins can now schedule WooCommerce recommended products as one-time or recurring suggestions, giving the flexibility to tailor updates weekly. Choose between automatic or manual updates, with full control over when and how recommendations are generated, thanks to custom scheduling. 

You can now Personalize recommendations by including product details like **Product price**, **URLs**, and **Categories** for more targeted WooCommerce product recommendations. Boost sales with AI-driven suggestions that incorporate sales data to highlight often-bought-together items. Plus, easily modify AI-generated recommendations via a simple log page, ensuring only the most relevant products are showcased.

**Enhanced Email Notifications: Personalized Product Recommendations for Users**
Boost customer engagement with advanced email notifications that highlight WooCommerce recommended products, along with powerful customization options.

1. **Price Drop Email Notification**
Keep your customers informed with timely updates on price drops. Admins can mark products as "**Featured Sale Items**" directly on the product page. Emails can be scheduled for all customers or tailored for users with recently viewed products for WooCommerce. **Featuring the top 5 most expensive sale items**, these emails ensure fresh recommendations without repetition for 15 days, keeping customers engaged with AI product recommendations for WooCommerce.

2. **New Recommendations Email Notification**
Admins can now schedule custom email alerts featuring the top 5 most expensive newly published related products based on user browsing history. These AI product recommendations for WooCommerce are **sent at intervals defined by the admin** and are carefully curated to prevent repeating products within a 15-day span. Additionally, any previously set schedules are automatically canceled when new ones are created, ensuring timely and relevant WooCommerce product recommendations.

3. **Recently Viewed Products Email Notifications**
Reconnect with customers by reminding them of products they've recently viewed. Admins can schedule reminders to be sent after a specified duration, featuring the **top 5 priciest products**. This approach not only keeps your WooCommerce product recommendations relevant but also avoids sending the same product more than once within a 15-day window.

4. **Settings to Customize Email Templates**
Admins can take full control of email design and content. Customize email subjects using filters, ensuring personalized and targeted messaging. **Add logos**, **set header** and **button colors**, and **adjust layout elements for a professional look**. GDPR compliance is built-in, with an option to **disable email prompts at checkout**, giving customers greater control while maintaining a polished email experience for WooCommerce product recommendations.

**Sales Booster**

By presenting tailored recommendations, the plugin significantly increases the likelihood of additional purchases. For instance, a customer buying a new laptop might be suggested a compatible laptop bag and mouse, encouraging them to add these items to their cart. This strategy is effective both before the checkout process, by suggesting complementary products, and after a purchase, by recommending associated items or those that might interest the customer based on their purchase history. It's a powerful way to increase average order value and boost sales through cross-selling and upselling.

**Optimized for Performance and Engagement**

Understanding the importance of website performance, the plugin is designed with an AJAX slider that loads products dynamically. This means your site remains fast, and the shopping experience seamless, even as customers interact with the recommendation widgets. Additionally, the customization options available allow you to align the widget's appearance and behavior with your store's theme and brand identity.

**Enhanced Shopping Experience**

The plugin creates a uniquely personalized shopping journey by analyzing each customer's browsing and purchasing behavior. Imagine a customer interested in gardening tools who has previously viewed several types of garden hoses. On their next visit, they're greeted with recommendations for sprinklers, gloves, and gardening books, all aligned with their interests. This level of personalization makes shopping not just a task but an enjoyable experience, as customers discover products they love with minimal effort. It's akin to having a personal shopper who knows exactly what you're looking for, making product discovery faster and more relevant.

**Improved Product Visibility**

With thousands of products available in online stores, customers can easily miss items that might be of interest to them. "AI Product Recommendations for WooCommerce" addresses this by highlighting new, associated, or previously overlooked products. For example, a hidden gem in your catalog associated with a customer's past purchases can be brought to their attention, significantly increasing its chances of being sold. This feature not only enhances the shopping experience by ensuring customers don't miss out on great products but also maximizes the visibility of your inventory.

**Control and Customization**

Customization is key in today's online marketplace. "AI Product Recommendations for WooCommerce" offers unparalleled control over how product recommendations are showcased, allowing store owners to move beyond the limitations of default WooCommerce shortcodes. You can customize everything from the number of products per row to the specific items that appear in each recommendation widget. This level of customization ensures that the recommendations align perfectly with your store's design and branding, creating a cohesive and engaging shopping experience. It empowers store owners to curate the shopping environment meticulously, ensuring that the right products are highlighted to the right customers at the right time.

In summary, "AI Product Recommendations for WooCommerce" is not just a plugin; it's a comprehensive solution for enhancing the online shopping experience, boosting sales, and optimizing your WooCommerce store's performance and customization. It's an essential tool for any store owner looking to stay competitive in the ever-evolving world of e-commerce.
